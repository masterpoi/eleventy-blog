Wow, it has been a busy three weeks, and even though my music did get attention, the publishing step seems to have slipped my mind ...
So to make it up to you, I'll bring you not 1 but 2 mixes simultaneously ! ;-)
First we have a 'good ol' house-y set, where I tried to start and finish in the same mood: chilly and relaxed, with Luigi Sambuy's Ocean, and the brilliant Of Sea by Nuage & Omfeel (this time in Lycoriscoris' Remix, blended together with the acoustic version !).
I hope you like this one already...
And stick around for set number 2, which will be very appropriately linked to this one ;-)
