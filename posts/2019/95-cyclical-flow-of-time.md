<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Playing tracks by

Stefan Obermaier, Bonobo, Cid Inc, Fluida, Golan Zocher feat. Rona(IL) and more.

<!-- Excerpt End -->
 
As the title of the first track may reveal, this one was started at around Christmas already. We start off a little slowly, after which we get started with the terrific Rosewood by Bonobo. At the middle of the set, we have a lovely trio of breaks, including the unexpected collaboration between Gardenstate and Gjon's Tears. You may remember that guy from the Eurovision Song Contest !
I hope you like it as much as I do :-)
